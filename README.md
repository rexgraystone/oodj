## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.

    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

    It should look something like this ![Java Version](Images/Java_Version.png "Java Version")

    If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

    - To install Java on Ubuntu, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-20-04).

    - To install Java on macOS, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html).

    - To install Java on Windows, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command.

    ```bash
    gh repo clone rexgraystone/oodj
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rexgraystone/oodj.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

    ```bash
    cd oodj
    ```

4. Compile the Java program using the following command.

    ```bash
    javac <Serial Number>_<Java File Name>.java
    ```

    For example, to compile the first program, you can use the following command.

    ```bash
    javac 1_Electricity.java
    ```

    The serial number is the number in the first column of the table above.

5. Run the Java program using the following command.

    ```bash
    java <Java File Name>.class
    ```

    For example, to run the first program, you can use the following command.

    ```bash
    java 1_Electricity.class
    ```

### Note

The programs are written in Java and compiled using the JDK version 17.0.2. on macOS Monterey 12.0.1.
